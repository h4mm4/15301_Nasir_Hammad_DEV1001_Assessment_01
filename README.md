Expense Tracker App

The purpose of this project is to construct a Python software that allows you (the user) to track and classify your monthly spending and budget.

The program allows users to enter their spending category and amount straight into the terminal. It will then save (add) the expense entry to the file. Finally, read the file to get a summary of the expenses for that month.

It will also advise the user how much they may spend for the rest of the month to stay under budget (which is a custom figure set by your app, such as $2000).
