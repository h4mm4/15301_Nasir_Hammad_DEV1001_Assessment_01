Expense Tracker App
************************

This project aims to construct Python software that allows you (the user) to track and classify your monthly spending and budget.

The program allows users to enter their spending category and amount straight into the terminal. It will then save (add) the expense entry to the file. Finally, could you read the file to get a summary of the expenses for that month?

It will also advise the user how much they may spend for the rest of the month to stay under budget (a custom figure set by your app, such as $2000).

App Requirements
****************************
1. Ask the user to add a cost (name, category, amount).
2. Save the expenditure entries as a.csv file.
3. Read the file to summarise the expenses for that month.
4. Show the user how much they can spend for the rest of the month (to stay under budget).

Extra 
********************
1. Display costs by category.
2. Give the customer a general estimate of how much they have left to spend per day.


Tasks
********************
1. Create the expense.py class.
2. Create the expense_tracker.py file and write the application's core logic.
3. Run the app to test it.
